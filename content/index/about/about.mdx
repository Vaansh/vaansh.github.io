import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Born in 1995, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I
started building my first websites and got more and more
interested in the digital economy.

After school, I started to study <Underlining highlight>e-commerce as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at the University of Applied Sciences Wedel. There, I learnt everything
about how to launch, develop, and market a digital business. Moreover, I was lucky enough to work as a cooperative student for several companies of the Otto Group, such as OTTO and ABOUT YOU. Beside studying,
I also worked occasionally as a <Underlining highlight>freelance web developer</Underlining>.

Currently, I work as a <Underlining highlight>Product Manager</Underlining> at <a href="https://www.otto.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">otto.de</a>.
