import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/Underlining";

Born in 1995, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I
started building my first websites and got more and more
interested in the digital economy. 

After school, I started to study <Underlining color="#CDF3E1" hoverColor="#CDF3E1">e-commerce as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at the University of Applied Sciences Wedel. There, I learnt everything
about how to launch, develop, and market a digital business. Moreover, I was lucky enough to work as a cooperative student for several companies of the Otto Group, such as OTTO and ABOUT YOU. Beside studying, 
I also worked occasionally as a <Underlining color="#CDF3E1" hoverColor="#CDF3E1">freelance web developer</Underlining>.

Currently, I work as a <Underlining color="#CDF3E1" hoverColor="#CDF3E1">Product Manager</Underlining> at <a href="https://www.otto.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">otto.de</a>.
