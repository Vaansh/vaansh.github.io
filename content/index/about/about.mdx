import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Born in 2002, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As I made my
way through school, I grew an interest in programming which would
serve as the basis for my future endeavors.

After school, I started to study <Underlining highlight>computer science as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at Concordia University. Here I had
the opportunity to work as a software developer for Genetec, dcbel and Morgan Stanley. I was able to educate myself on different topics ranging from <Underlining highlight>application development to data science</Underlining> as a student.

Currently, I am looking for the opportunities in the summer semester or new grad roles in FinTech.
